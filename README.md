# conways-game-of-life-c
This repository contains an implementation of Conway's Game of Life written in C. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

##Features

    Random initialization of the grid with cells in either dead or alive state.
    Automatic updating of the grid based on Conway's rules.
    Simple and portable implementation suitable for Unix-like environments.

##Requirements

To run the program, you need:

    A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
    A Unix-like environment (e.g., Linux or macOS)

##Usage

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

##bash

git clone https://github.com/MuhammadIrtaza/game-of-life-c.git

    Navigate to the repository directory:

##bash

cd game-of-life-c

    Compile the program:

gcc -o game_of_life game_of_life.c

    Run the program:

##bash

./game_of_life
