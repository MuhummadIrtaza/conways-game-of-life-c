# conways-game-of-life-c
This repository contains an implementation of Conway's Game of Life written in C. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
